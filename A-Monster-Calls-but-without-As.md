# One Monster Beckons
(A monster calls without a single A)

*One Monster Beckons*

The monster showed up succeeding midnight. Like they do.


Conor did not sleep when it did come.

Conor owned one night terror. Well, not *one* night terror. *The* night terror. The one he'd been owning plenty recently. The one with the murk, the wind, the shouting. The one with the fingers slipping from him, however firm he tried to hold on. The one which kept ending with-

"Get lost," Conor whispered into the murk of his bedroom, trying to push the night terror behind him, not let it follow him to the world of consciousness. "Get lost now."

He looked over to the clock his mum put on his bedside desk. 12.07. Twelve minutes beyond midnight. Behind time for the night before school, behind time for the weekend, definitely.

He'd told no one of the night terror. Not his mum, obviously, but no one else either, not his pop in their fortnightly (or so) phone conference, *definitely* not his eldmother, no one in school. Definitely not.

No one else ever needed to know the plot storyline in his night terror.

Conor blinked groggily in his room, then he frowned. Something seemed to be missing. He got up from his sleep, rousing more. The night terror slowly retired, but something which he could not put his finger on bothered him, something different, something-

He listened, exterting his energy on the silence, but he could only hear the quiet house he was within, the intermittent tick from the empty first floor or the rustle of bedding from his mum's room next door.

Nothing.

Then something. Something which woke him, he noted.

Someone was beckoning him with his title.

*Conor.*

He felt rushes of fright, his guts twisting. Did it follow him? Did it somehow step out of the night terror then-

"Don't be stupid," he told himself. "You're too old for monsters."

Indeed, he'd turned thirteen in September. Monsters were for newborns. Monsters were for bed-wetters. Monsters were for-

*Conor.*

There once more. Conor gulped. The month was oddly hot, with his window still open. The sounds of the blinds shushing in the slight breeze could sound possibly like-

*Conor.*

OK, it's not the wind. It seemed to be definitely one voice, but not one he recognised. For sure, I couldn't be his mother's. It completely didn't sound like the opposite gender, pressing Conor for one nutty moment to wonder if his pop somehow surprisingly visited from the US but got there too behind time to phone so-

*Conor.*

No. Not his pop. This voice owned texture, very monstrous texture, wild.
