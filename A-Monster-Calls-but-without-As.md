# One Monster Beckons
(A monster calls without a single A)

*One Monster Beckons*

The monster showed up succeeding midnight. Like they do.

Conor did not sleep when it did come.

Conor owned one night terror. Well, not *one* night terror. *The* night terror. The one he'd been owning plenty recently. The one with the murk, the wind, the shouting. The one with the fingers slipping from him, however firm he tried to hold on. The one that kept ending with-

"Get lost," Conor whispered into the murk of his bedroom, trying to push the night terror behind him, not let it follow him to the world of consciousness. "Get lost now."

He looked over to the clock his mum put on his bedside desk. 12.07. Twelve minutes beyond midnight. Behind time for the night before school, behind time for the weekend, of course.
