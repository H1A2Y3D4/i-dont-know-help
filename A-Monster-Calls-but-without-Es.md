#A monster Calls

That colossus was in sight just past midnight. As most do.

Conor was conscious when it hit town.

Conor had had a bad story unfold in his mind. Not *a* bad story. *That* bad story. That of which Conor had a lot of for many days. The bad story that had that conclusion of-

“Go away,” Conor said softly into the gloom of his room, trying to push the bad story back, not allow it follow him into the world of waking. “Go away now.”

Conor took a quick look at the clock his mum had put on his nightstand. 12.07. Seven minutes past midnight. Which was tardy for a school night, tardy for a Sunday, beyond doubt.

Conor had told no one about the bad story. Not his mum, obviously, not a soul, not his dad in their fortnightly (or so) phone call, certainly not his grandma, and nobody at school.

Obviously not.

What occured in the bad story was nothing nobody on any account wanted to know.

Conor blinked groggily at his room, at that point he frowned. Conor noticed an individual missing. 

Conor sat up in his couch, waking an additional bit. The bad story was slipping from him, but he couldn't put his digit on, a thing was dissimilar, a thing– Conor took notice,
straining against the tranquility, but all he could notice was the still habitation around him, the occasional tick from the vacant downstairs or a swish of bedding from his mum’s room abutting door.

Nothing.

And then something. Something he saw was the thing that had stirred him.

A dignitary was calling his anonym.

Conor.
